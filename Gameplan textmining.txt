	Depending on subquestion:
		Obama's tweets during and/or after last year of presidency on personal account
		Trump's tweets before and/or during his first year of presidency

Subject analysis:
	determine x subjects per tweet using GENSIM and store all subjects.
		Create wordcloud based on subject frequency
