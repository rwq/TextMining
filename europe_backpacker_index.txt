London View Eye Big BenPrices for tourist in Europe's most popular cities range from amazing bargains to astonishingly expensive. Now in its 8th year, the Europe Backpacker Index is designed to help you sort out the cheapest European cities and make an accurate budget for when you visit Europe.

Europe has continued to be stable with very low inflation in most countries, so things going into 2018 haven't changed dramatically. The European currencies have all gained ground on the US Dollar after being unusually low for a few years, but still the prices you'll find here are quite reasonable considering the sights and thrills you'll experience.

As the year 2018 is about to kick off, the European currencies including the Euro itself are more or less on par with historical averages. The British Pound continues to be weak in the wake of the Brexit decision, so the UK remains a pretty good bargain compared to the recent decades.
Are you a hotel person rather than a hostel person?

If your budget is higher than that of a backpacker you should check out our:
>>>Europe 3-Star Traveler Index

The above list shows some significant shifts for some cities on the list below, indicating that certain destinations are better bargains than others, depending on your style of travel.
How the Backpacker Index works

Prices for most things (hostels, transportation, attractions) are fixed and certain, but prices for a “budget lunch” or a pint of beer can vary depending on where you go. Still, our estimates are based on a lot of research, and should be very close if not right on.

Costs for each city

    One night in the cheapest bunk at the least expensive hostel with a good location and good reviews
    Two public transportation rides per day
    One paid/famous attraction per day (Every city is loaded with free things to do for budget-conscious travelers, but here we take the average cost of a major attraction in each city for each day.)
    Three “budget” meals per day (We took our minimum meal price and added 20% to make it more realistic for a longer trip).
    Three cheap, local beers (or wine) each day as an “entertainment fund.” Non-drinkers might have dessert and coffee or attend a local music performance instead, so this is a general benchmark that should be proportional for each city.

We've added an interactive map that shows the Backpacker Index price for each city as you roll over it with your cursor. You can click on the city names to see all the details about each city as well. They might not be all of the largest cities, but these are the best places to visit in Europe.

Europe Backpacker Index for 2018

From cheapest to most expensive
1 – Kiev, Ukraine (cheapest)

KievNewKiev has always been fairly cheap (and very remote) compared to the rest of Europe, but as of now it's the clear leader when it comes to cheap and large cities. The conflicts from a few years ago have settled down as of late, but that still doesn't mean people are flocking to Kiev to take advantage of a cheap weekend break. Do with this information what you will.

    Currency: Ukraine Hryvnia
    Best cheap hostel: ZigZag Hostel – 150/night
    Transportation: 10.00
    Meals: 432.00
    Drinks/Entertainment: 90.00
    Attractions: 15.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: UHR697.00 = US$25.04/day

>>>Kiev prices and weather
2 – Krakow, Poland

Krakow continues yet again as Europe's best travel bargain. The low prices have drawn in larger numbers of Europeans for weekend breaks, and there are many great and cheap hostels, bars, and restaurants to keep prices low while you are enjoying the beautiful old city and the local culture. Put this one on your list before demand forces prices up like in Prague and Budapest.

    Currency: Polish Zlotych
    Best cheap hostel: Pillows Party Hostel – 28.40/night
    Transportation: 5.60
    Meals: 24.00
    Drinks/Entertainment: 24.00
    Attractions: 16.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: PLN98.00 = US$27.68/day

>>>Krakow prices and weather
3 – Belgrade, Serbia

Belgrade is one of the Balkan cities that had years of trouble in the 1990s and still struggles a bit to attract tourism. This is another where you won't find an abundance of checklist attractions, but you will find a lively and interesting urban center with good nightlife and appealing prices. Among the cheap European cities, Belgrade might not be high on your list, but it's nicer and more pleasant than you probably imagine.

    Currency: Serbian Dinar (prices below are in euros)
    Best cheap hostel: Hostel Inn Downtown – 4.97/night
    Transportation: 1.50
    Meals: 9.60
    Drinks/Entertainment: 4.50
    Attractions: 3.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €23.57 = US$28.06/day

>>>Belgrade prices and weather
4 – Bucharest, Romania

Definitely not Romania's most charming town, Bucharest's Old Town gets decent reviews but the rest of the city struggles to appeal to tourists. Fortunately, those that make the effort to come will at least be rewarded with low prices all around, which certainly help make up for the other frustrations of visiting. And that huge parliament building is worth a look. Hostels seem to be getting cheaper lately, so it's even more appealing for the backpacker set.

    Currency: Romanian leu
    Best cheap hostel: Little Bucharest Bar & Hostel = 34.50/night
    Transportation: 5.00
    Meals: 45.60
    Drinks/Entertainment: 15.00
    Attractions: 12.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: RON112.10 – US$28.82/day

>>>Bucharest prices and weather
5 – Sofia, Bulgaria

Sofia remains a good bargain among European capitals, with a very pleasant city center that is quite welcoming of foreign tourists. Prices of nearly everything are cheap, except for inbound flights from other major cities, and hostel beds have become a bit more expensive lately. Even for those planning to travel Europe cheap, Sofia is out of the way for anyone who isn't doing an extensive tour of the region. Don't expect any major checklist attractions, but you can expect a surprisingly lovely urban experience at shockingly reasonable prices.

    Currency: Bulgaria Leva
    Best cheap hostel: Hostel Mostel – 19.55 (includes breakfast)
    Transportation: 3.20
    Meals: 16.80
    Drinks/Entertainment: 7.50
    Attractions: 6.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: BGN53.05 = US$32.15/day

>>>Sofia prices and weather
6 – Budapest, Hungary

Another excellent travel bargain, Budapest is all-around cheap as long as you steer clear of the most touristy places along the river. The castles and cathedrals are enough, but here you also get thermal spas that are cheap even for the backpacking set. Hostels, in particular, are great value, but you have to get a bit out of the center to find inexpensive hotels. When you are there it doesn't look like it would be on a list of inexpensive European cities, but it definitely is.

    Currency: Hungary Forint
    Best cheap hostel: Sziget City Hostel – 2,234/night
    Transportation: 700
    Meals: 3120
    Drinks/Entertainment: 1050
    Attractions: 1800
    Daily Backpacker Index: HUF8,904 = US$33.86/day

>>>Budapest prices and weather
7 – Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina

Another Balkan-area city whose name conjures up images of its past troubles, Sarajevo is a destination that is struggling to attract tourists. The location deep into the mountains is remote, but it's also gorgeous once you arrive. The Muslim Old Town next to the modern center is very interesting and incredibly welcoming. This one is a hidden gem, partly because it's so hard to reach. If you can figure out a way to get here, do it and see what the fuss is about.

    Currency: Converted Mark (fixed, so prices below are in euros)
    Best cheap hostel: Travellers Home Hostel – 7.95/night
    Transportation: 3.60
    Meals: 9.60
    Drinks/Entertainment: 3.75
    Attractions: 4.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €28.90 = US$34.40/day

>>>Sarajevo prices and weather
8 – Zagreb, Croatia

The beach resort towns of Croatia are the main attraction, so Zagreb, which is well inland, tends to be only a short stop for most. Still fairly cheap by European standards, and especially compared to Italy next door, Zagreb is a bargain and a worthwhile pause on the way to one of the beach towns or nearby Plitvice National Park.

    Currency: Croatian kuna
    Best cheap hostel: Hostel Temza – 54.00/night
    Transportation: 20
    Meals: 84
    Drinks/Entertainment: 36
    Attractions: 30
    Daily Backpacker Index: HRK224.00 = US$35.16/day

>>>Zagreb prices and weather
9 – Riga, Latvia

It's surprising to see a city so far north also so high on the cheap-cities list, but it turns out that Riga is quite a bargain for the backpacking set. Hostel beds in particular are very affordable, and so is pretty much everything else. Riga's main problem is that it's a bit out of the way for those not on an extensive tour. Even for a weekend break, Riga is worth a look, especially for the nightlife crowd.

    Currency: Euro
    Best cheap hostel: Central Hostel Riga – 6.50/night
    Transportation: 2.30
    Meals: 12.00
    Drinks/Entertainment: 6.00
    Attractions: 3.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €29.80 = US$34.40/day

>>>Riga prices and weather
10 – Istanbul, Turkey

The classic east-meets-west city had been creeping up in price, but the decline of the Turkish Lira in recent years has made it a bargain again. Tourism to Turkey in general is well down from a few years ago, even though tourists haven't had any trouble here in a long time. There's no shortage of markets, mosques, and attractions for even a longer stay, and everywhere else in Turkey is cheaper. Accommodation is more expensive than you might expect. Check our list of recommended cheap Istanbul hotels for bargains in all price ranges.

    Currency: Turkish lira
    Best cheap hostel: Chambers of the Boheme – 31.63/night
    Transportation: 8.00
    Meals: 38.40
    Drinks/Entertainment: 30.00
    Attractions: 30.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: TRY138.03 = US$36.13/day

>>>Istanbul prices and weather
11 – Warsaw, Poland

While Krakow gets most of the raves in Poland, the capital city also has plenty to brag about in addition to very reasonable prices. The Old Town center was famously rebuilt after WWII to resemble its former self, and it's as charming as it is impressive. Warsaw is a bit out of the way for most travelers, but it's very worthwhile for those touring the area.

    Currency: Polish Zlotych
    Best cheap hostel: Tatamka Hostel – 35.83/night
    Transportation: 6.80
    Meals: 39.60
    Drinks/Entertainment: 24.00
    Attractions: 27.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: PLN133.23 = US$37.64/day

>>>Warsaw prices and weather
12 – Ceský Krumlov, Czech Republic

CeskyKrumlovThe second most popular tourist town in the Czech Republic is another jewel not to be missed if you are nearby. Framed by a gorgeous serpentine river, the historic Old Town feels perfectly preserved yet not overly touristy. Best of all, Ceský Krumlov seems shockingly cheap when you are there, with hotels, food, and drinks at very low prices even in the heart of town. This place is a huge hit for Asian tourists, for some reason, though it's highly recommended for everybody.

    Currency: Czech krona
    Best cheap hostel: Hostel Merlin – 298/night
    Transportation: 48
    Meals: 288
    Drinks/Entertainment: 90
    Attractions: 100
    Daily Backpacker Index: CZK824 = US$38.13/day

>>>Ceský Krumlov prices and weather
13 – Vilnius, Lithuania

VilniusUnlike nearby Riga and Tallinn, the city of Vilnius does not have a cruise port and it's well inland. For this reason it feels far less touristy than the other two, and the Old Town is gorgeous. This is another Baltic capital that is surprisingly cheap in many ways, so it's a worthwhile stop between Latvia and Poland. The (hard to find) Frank Zappa statue is one of the more famous quirky attractions here.

    Currency: Euro
    Best cheap hostel: Downtown Forest Hostel & Camping – 8.00/night
    Transportation: 2.00
    Meals: 13.20
    Drinks/Entertainment: 6.00
    Attractions: 3.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €32.20 = US$38.33/day

>>>Vilnius prices and weather
14 – Bratislava, Slovakia

You'd think that practically being walking distance from Vienna would make Bratislava a very popular stop for those on a Europe tour, but so far it's still mostly forgotten. It's cheaper than Prague and much cheaper than Vienna, so perhaps it will start catching on more in the coming years. A lack of famous attractions doesn't help, though the pleasant and historic town center is worth a day or two.

    Currency: Euro
    Best cheap hostel: Hostel Brickyard – 11.90/night
    Transportation: 1.40
    Meals: 12.00
    Drinks/Entertainment: 6.00
    Attractions: 4.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €35.30 = US$42.02/day

>>>Bratislava prices and weather
15 – Split, Croatia

SplitSplit is partly known for being the transportation hub along the Croatian coast, and the gateway to many nearby islands. But the Old City here is even older than Dubrovnik's and in many ways it's just as impressive. Prices here are far cheaper than those in Dubrovnik, so it's a much better stop for most people, as it also feels far less touristy than the walled city to its south. If you visit Split first you will wonder why there is such a fuss over Dubrovnik.

    Currency: Croatian kuna
    Best cheap hostel: CroParadise Green Hostel – 69.67/night
    Transportation: 18
    Meals: 100.80
    Drinks/Entertainment: 42
    Attractions: 40
    Daily Backpacker Index: 270.47 = US$42.46/day

>>>Split prices and weather
16 – Santorini, Greece

SantoriniArguably Greece's most popular holiday island, Santorini is here mainly as a placeholder for all of them. There are a few sights and cultural attractions but most people (Europeans) come to just relax in the sun during the day and drink into the night. If you stay in hostels or basic hotels and eat in places without sea views, these Greek islands all tend to be quite affordable. Hostel and hotel prices in the summer months are obviously higher, but it's still quite affordable once you get here.

    Currency: Euro
    Best cheap hostel: Youth Hostel Anna – 6/night
    Transportation: 3.20
    Meals: 15.60
    Drinks/Entertainment: 10.50
    Attractions: 3.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €38.30 = US$45.60/day

>>>Santorini prices and weather
17 – Saint Petersburg, Russia

Not unlike Kiev, the Russian currency plunged starting in 2014 and into 2015, and inflation ate up most of those savings. Far more tourist-friendly than Moscow, Saint Petersburg is also cheaper and arguably more interesting. Most things are very affordable, and the city would seem even cheaper if its incredible Hermitage Museum/Winter Palace didn't (justifiably) cost so much. Hotels and tourist restaurants aren't so cheap, however. Prices here could drift up or down as 2018 goes on.

    Currency: Russian ruble
    Best cheap hostel: Plosaty Hostel – 420/night
    Transportation: 90
    Meals: 1,236
    Drinks/Entertainment: 600
    Attractions: 400
    Daily Backpacker Index: RUB2,746 = US$46.79/day

>>>Saint Petersburg prices and weather
18 – Ljubljana, Slovenia

LjubljanaSlovenia is mostly known for its natural sights such as Lake Bled or the Karst plateaus, but its capital is definitely worth a look as well. Ljubljana is a charming and laid-back city with a peaceful Old Town and very appealing prices for visitors. This is the kind of place you'll think about moving to when you see it, so it's a very nice place to chill out for a few days on longer trips around Europe.

    Currency: Euro
    Best cheap hostel: Hostel 24 – 11.89/night
    Transportation: 2.40
    Meals: 16.20
    Drinks/Entertainment: 6
    Attractions: 5
    Daily Backpacker Index: €41.49 = US$49.39/day

>>>Ljubljana prices and weather
19 – Prague, Czech Republic

In the 1990s Prague was always used as an example of a city that is incredibly cheap yet still beautiful and historic, but that sort of chit-chat triggered the masses to flood in. Still, in spite of high-ish hotel prices, Prague is still quite cheap for those willing to stay in hostels and scout for bargain food and drinks. Plus, it's still gorgeous, if crowded. Choose from our recommended hotels in Prague list for excellent values at top-rated hotels.

    Currency: Czech krona
    Best cheap hostel: Czech Inn – 265/night
    Transportation: 48
    Meals: 372
    Drinks/Entertainment: 105
    Attractions: 300
    Daily Backpacker Index: CZK1,090 = US$50.44/day

>>>Prague prices and weather
20 – Tallinn, Estonia

Tallinn is cheap by most European standards, but it's the most expensive city in the Baltic area because it's a popular getaway for the Finns just a 2-hour ferry ride away. Frequent ferries from Helsinki are loaded with the party crowd and those looking to stock up on bulk alcohol for the return trip. Still, it's a fun place with a lovely Old Town.

    Currency: euro
    Best cheap hostel: Old Town Alur Hostel – 11.00/night
    Transportation: 2.00
    Meals: 14.40/li>
    Drinks/Entertainment: 9.00
    Attractions: 6.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €42.40 = US$50.48/day

>>>Tallinn prices and weather
21 – Tenerife, Spain

The Canary Islands (off the northwest coast of Africa) are a popular warm-weather retreat for many Europeans all year, and Tenerife is the largest and most popular island with English speakers. Prices tend to be similar to or a bit lower than mainland Spain, which makes it a relative bargain for most Europeans who are just a cheap flight away. Not many cultural attractions to be found, so it's mainly a place to relax. The beaches in the southwest of the island are the most popular with English speakers.

    Currency: Euro
    Best cheap hostel: Los Amigos Backpackers Hostel – 14.90/night
    Transportation: 2.70
    Meals: 14.40
    Drinks/Entertainment: 7.50
    Attractions: 5.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €44.50 = US$52.98/day

>>>Tenerife prices and weather
22 – Valletta, Malta

VallettaNearly hidden just a bit south of Sicily in the Mediterannean, Malta is a small island group with a pleasant climate and an improving tourist infrastructure. The tiny capital city of Valletta is a UNESCO World Heritage site on its own, and the rest of the islands offer a nice mix of historical sites and pleasant beaches. Nearly everyone speaks English, so it continues to be popular with Brits. Valletta is actually the historic Old Town and most visitors are better off just across the harbor in the district called Sliema.

    Currency: Euro
    Best cheap hostel: Granny’s Inn Hostel – 10.80/night
    Transportation: 3
    Meals: 15.60
    Drinks/Entertainment: 7.50
    Attractions: 6.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €44.90 = US$53.45/day

>>>Valletta prices and weather
23 – Athens, Greece

The Greek capital was once one of Europe's great bargain cities, and it has become reasonable again after the political instability in recent years. The infrastructure created for the Olympics has actually turned Athens into a modern and easy-to-visit place, and the Acropolis and other attractions continue to amaze, so it still seems like a good deal for the moment and may get even cheaper. Political protests have kept some people away, which has helped keep hotel and hostel prices affordable.

    Currency: euro
    Best cheap hostel: Zorbas Hostel – 10/night
    Transportation: 2.80
    Meals: 19.20
    Drinks/Entertainment: 7.50
    Attractions: 8.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €47.50 = US$56.55/day

>>>Athens prices and weather
24 – Naples, Italy

Italy's cheapest major city is a very good bargain for those willing to venture south of Rome. Affordable hostels and casual dining choices keep it cheaper than cities to the north, and it has a different atmosphere as well. Naples has almost no green space and a reputation for petty crime, which keeps many visitors away. If you want to see Naples on a day trip and also visit the Amalfi Coast, Pompeii, and the island of Capri, you are better off staying in the lovely town of Sorrento, which is only a bit more expensive.

    Currency: euro
    Best cheap hostel: Fabric Hostel & Club – 15/night
    Transportation: 2.60
    Meals: 15.60
    Drinks/Entertainment: 6.00
    Attractions: 9.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €48.20 = US$57.38/day

>>>Naples prices and weather
25 – Lisbon, Portugal

Its out-of-the-way location seems to keep tourism well below the levels that the city otherwise deserves, but those who go to the trouble to reach Lisbon will find an extremely handsome and charming city that is a great bargain as well. The city is particularly known for excellent and cheap hostels that are always in a race to outdo each other, with visitors being the ultimate winners. Lisbon is one of those destinations that many people avoid for a long time, and then after they visit they vow to return again and again.

    Currency: euro
    Best cheap hostel: Urban Garden Hostel – 12.86/night
    Transportation: 2.80
    Meals: 16.80
    Drinks/Entertainment: 9.00
    Attractions: 8.00
    Daily Backpacker Index: €49.46 = US$58.88/day

>>>Lisbon prices and weather
26 – Moscow, Russia

Certainly one of the world's most important cities, Moscow continues also to be frustrating for many travelers, with relatively few hostels and traveler-friendly budget restaurants. The currency collapse brought prices down, although inflation has been bringing them back up again. Still, if you can get through the paperwork and find a cheap flight, it's a fairly cheap place for backpacker-types. Tourist hotels and restaurants can be quite expensive, so even though it's somewhat cheap for those willing to search for local deals, Moscow can be a drain for 3-star and above travelers.

    Currency: Russian ruble
    Best cheap hostel: Vagabond Hostel 750/night
    Transportation: 100
    Meals: 1,416

27 – Madrid, Spain

This classic European city definitely feels like a bargain compared to capitals to the north. There is great competition among its many hostels, and even private rooms in the city center are often cheap. Check out our cheap Madrid hotels list for well located and dependable bargains. Another money saver is the tapas culture, with cheap eats and cheap glasses of beer or wine as part of the nightly ritual.

28 – Hamburg, Germany

This somewhat remote city is largely forgotten by most North American visitors, known best as where the Beatles honed their chops, but Hamburg is a lovely and classy city that is worth a stop if you are in the area. Germans, in general, like good value, so there are plenty of good budget sleeping and eating options for the backpacker types. Hotel prices here are heavily influenced by trade fairs and business travelers, so it can be cheap one week and very expensive the next.

29 – Ibiza, Spain

While it's not really considered a backpacking destination, Ibiza is popular enough with budget travelers to include here. Hotels can be quite cheap outside of July and August, which makes up for a lack of hostels. Entrance to the main nightclubs in Ibiza will cost a fortune, as will drinks once inside, but if you are content to hang out on the beach then this island can be affordable. Note that the hostel price here is for late April, and in summer it will be considerably more. If these rankings were for July, Ibiza would be way down this list, so it's only really a bargain in the off season.

30 – Nice, France

As the largest city on the Côte d'Azur, Nice actually has a decent infrastructure for budget tourists, though things can get pretty crowded in summer and prices do shoot up. This is a great base for exploring Monaco and Cannes with a short train journey, but even in the city itself there is plenty to do, and a pleasant beach if you don't mind rocks where the sand should be.

Note: Drink prices here are for wine rather than beer, as it's much cheaper and better as well.

31 – Berlin, Germany

Berlin is officially booming, and is now one of Europe's most-visited destinations. This city has endless things to see and do, along with an arts and entertainment scene that rivals anywhere in Europe. The museums and attractions are priced reasonably, and can be efficiently bundled with a Berlin Card. All that, plus the competition among its many hostels keeps things pleasantly cheap.

32 – Salzburg, Austria

SalzburgA classic tourist city, Salzburg is at the base of the Alps and it has one of the most impressive Old Towns anywhere in Europe. As the birthplace of Mozart, Salzburg is a key hub for classical concerts and festivals, but for non-Europeans it's even more famous as the setting of the Sound of Music. The bus tours dedicated to that movie are more fun and far more scenic than you might expect.

33 – Florence, Italy

A highlight of so many Italy tours, Florence is cheaper than Rome and Venice in most regards. Hostel competition is fierce and quality is mostly quite good, so this is a good hang-out for weary backpackers. And the food is excellent, if not particularly cheap. If you have extra days to spend in Italy on day trips then Florence is your best choice in the area. Pisa, the Cinque Terre, and many lovely Tuscan hill towns are within easy reach.

34 – Edinburgh, Scotland

While it's certainly true that most things in Edinburgh are a bit cheaper than things in London, it's not exactly cheap for most budget travelers. Those who are satisfied with skipping the Edinburgh Castle and the Camera Obscura will find this city very reasonable, except during the Festival season. Speaking of that, check our Edinburgh cheap travel tips for the festival season, which can actually be helpful all year round.

35 – Dubrovnik, Croatia

Dubrovnik has one of the most amazing walled historic centers in the world, and it used to be considered a bargain compared to Italy. But now it's so popular with tourists and cruise passengers that it feels more than a bit pricey. If you are on the fence about visiting here, you are better off going to Split, which is similar, much cheaper, and easier to reach.

36 – Dublin, Ireland

For a city that was once considered cheap, Dublin still feels weirdly expensive, especially in light of the larger financial struggles a few years back. Fortunately there are some good deals on hostels these days, so hopefully other things (like €5+ for a pint of Guinness in even a dumpy bar!) will loosen up and make the city friendlier for backpackers and budget travelers. Speaking of Guinness, if you are going to do the Guinness Brewery and the popular distillery tour, then the Dublin Pass is a great deal.

37 – Bruges, Belgium

Bruges is a very good bargain for the backpacking set due to reasonably priced hostels and affordable attractions. In high season (summer) prices go up a bit, but still Bruges is a fine choice to chill out for a few days or more, even though you can see the main sights in less time.

38 – Barcelona, Spain

Barcelona and Madrid are very different in many important ways, but they are very similar in general prices so there's no reason not to visit both if you can. And this is another city where hostels tend to get expensive and crowded during summer, but are quite cheap for most of the rest of the year. See our cheap and recommended Barcelona hotels list for some options that are well located and highly rated. If you have 2 or 3 days in town and want to see the main sights you should read our Barcelona Pass review as it might be helpful.

39 – Munich, Germany

MunichGermany's most pleasant city is only a bit more expensive than the others, so budget travelers can get by with few complications as long as they aren't going during Oktoberfest (when hotel and hostel prices triple). Prices of hostels do shoot up a bit during summer, but overall it's fairly easy to find bargains, and the city is so livable that it feels like good value.

40 – Luxembourg City, Luxembourg

This underrated and mostly forgotten city is definitely worth a stop if you are passing between Belgium and France. The location is stunning and the city's history is interesting, plus the food and drink culture is what you would expect for this part of Europe, meaning there are a lot of great choices.

41 – Rome, Italy

Regardless of costs, Rome is one of those cities that you've just got to visit anyway, so fortunately it's not as outrageously expensive as some lesser destinations a bit down the list. There are good budget options for most things, but hotels and hostels are more expensive than one might expect, and the main Rome attractions are justifiably expensive as well. Choose from our recommended Rome hostels and hotels for excellent bargains with great locations. The Rome and Vatican Card is a good way to see the main attractions and skip the very long queues here.

42 – Vienna, Austria

Being one of Europe's grandest capitals, it's only slightly surprising that Vienna comes out as a relatively expensive city. Its location between so many other tourist cities makes it an easy one to stop off in for a few days, and while food is a bit expensive, there are some good-value hostels in the city to help make up for it. The Vienna Pass is a good way to save money while seeing the top attractions, but only if you are well organized.

43 – Brussels, Belgium

For the budget traveler, Brussels can be a bit difficult since the infrastructure is built mostly for business travelers and bureaucrats. There aren't many hostel options, and cheap meals are a challenge in the city center area. Still, it's worth a look for the main square alone if you are heading to or from Bruges, which is much cheaper and listed above.

>>>Brussels prices and weather
44 – Milan, Italy

Milan's success in finance and fashion have helped make it one of Europe's most expensive cities to sleep in, although the hostels aren't as outrageous, so overall expenses are similar to most other Italian cities. Since it's on-the-way between so many other nearby cities, Milan is definitely worth a stop for a day or two if you can manage it, but don't feel bad if you skip it. This is another city that is popular with business travelers so prices can be very high or weirdly low depending on what is going on at the moment.

45 – Paris, France

Similar to Rome, it's just a good thing that Paris isn't any more expensive than it is, because people are going to visit anyway. As long as you are willing to stay a bit outside the main tourist districts then Paris can be quite reasonable on the wallet, and the quality of food is exceptional nearly anywhere you go. The main attractions are actually fairly cheap compared to major sights in some other big cities, and you might save even more money with a Paris Pass. To get the best value have a look at our recommended Paris hostels and cheap hotels section.

Note: Drink prices here are for wine rather than beer, as it's much cheaper and better as well.

46 – Bergen, Norway

BergenEven with a lower Norwegian currency, Bergen is still very pricey compared to the rest of Europe. This is the gateway to the beautiful fjords of Norway, and the city itself is more interesting and easier to visit than Oslo. Actually, hotels here are very good quality and decent value. It's the food and drinks that feel so overpriced, and the few hostels feel weirdly expensive as well.

47 – Interlaken, Switzerland

InterlakenThe big cities in Switzerland are awesomely expensive because everything is priced for business travelers and the like, so budget travelers are better off skipping them in favor of the small towns of Interlaken or Lucerne to get better views and lower prices. Interlaken itself feels a bit tired, so head straight up to Gimmelwald or one of the other mountain towns for the best experience.

48 – Helsinki, Finland

Helsinki, like Stockholm and Oslo below, has a good economy, but along with it they have very high wages and taxes, and that makes things expensive for outsiders. Even hostels are quite expensive, and hotels are worse. As nice as it may be, if cities had prices reflecting their desirability, Helsinki would be much, much cheaper than it is.

49 – Copenhagen, Denmark

The Danish capital is one of the famously expensive Scandinavian cities, but its currency isn't as high as it once was so it feels like decent value. Quality does tend to be quite high, and Copenhagen is arguably one of the prettiest cities in all of Europe, so the higher prices feel somewhat justified. Still, it's a tough place for the backpacker crowd, especially for those who drink.

50 – Stockholm, Sweden

Backpackers who want to visit the homeland of most of their furniture have to go a long distance out of the way to reach Stockholm, and then face shocking prices once they arrive. This is another city where almost nothing is cheap no matter where you look. The long-promised ABBA Museum is now open and it's predictably expensive as well. This is a beautiful city that you will really enjoy for a few days, as long as you can afford it.

51 – London, England

London is famously pricey, but it's also a weird one for budget travelers since it actually has somewhat affordable hostels (at least outside of peak season), and all the major museums are actually free. However, pretty much everything else feels outrageously expensive, particularly the other attractions like the Tower of London and the London Eye. The post-Brexit currency slide has helped bring prices down, but it still aint exactly cheap. Those wishing to save by bundling these top attractions should consider a London Pass. For cheap hotel and hostel options see our recommended London hostel and hotels page.

52 – Amsterdam, Netherlands

From a price standpoint, Amsterdam may be a victim of its own popularity. Even with scores of hostels throughout the city center, they are still able to get fairly high rates even during shoulder season. Pick from our recommended Amsterdam hostels and cheap hotels for great value and locations. The famous attractions are on the expensive side, though good deals are always available on food and drinks if you know where to look. Budget travelers will have to book a place way outside the center in order to find a decent deal, and unfortunately Amsterdam loses some of its charm if you have to commute in and out like that.

As oil prices collapsed in late 2014, the Norwegian currency did as well. Now this gorgeous country is still pricey but not outrageous like it was a couple years ago when it was on par with Switzerland. Flights into Oslo can be quite cheap as well, although Bergen (see above) is probably a better choice if you have to choose just one.

54 – Reykjavik, Iceland

After its currency collapsed in 2008, Iceland cost about half what it did previously for foreigners, but prices crept up and up, and it's again very expensive. Reykjavik isn't a particularly charming city, which is fine because the appeal of Iceland is the amazing scenery everywhere else. If you plan a trip to Iceland, don't linger in the capital longer than you have to. Accommodation and food on rest of the island are also fairly expensive, but the whole island is stunning and almost everything is free once you get there.

No surprises to find Venice so far down the affordability list, but once again this is a city where it's all easily justifiable, and fortunately you can see all the main sights in just two days and one night if you are tight on funds. Of course, most cheaper hotels are not even on the main island, but getting back and forth is cheap and easy. Check our cheap and recommended Venice hotels list for some great choices.

56 – Zurich, Switzerland

Certainly no surprise here, especially considering that Zurich also came out on top on our survey of world taxi prices. Switzerland is a rich country and Zurich is its very-rich main city, so the hotel and restaurant scenes are dominated by business travelers and those on expense accounts. It's a nice enough place, but honestly, Bern is more interesting, and the highlights of the country are in the scenery rather than in the cities.
